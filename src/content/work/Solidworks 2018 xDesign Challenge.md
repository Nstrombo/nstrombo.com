During the off season of FRC after my first year on the team, I was tasked with leading the Solidworks XDesign Challenge submission. I learned Solidworks XDesign from scratch, making a futuristic lunar lander in 4 weeks. The lander was deigned to rescue one of our FRC robots that was stranded in space. It had mechanical spider legs, hinged gull wing doors, an actuated solar panel array, a retractable ramp, aerospike rocket motors, and reaction control thrusters. The inspiration for the body's unique shape was our team's use of the nonagon, the 9 sided shape which makes many appearances on each robot we build.

We were awarded second place for the design, and my teammate and I were invited to speak at Solidworks Worlds 2019 to discuss collaboration in design and to highlight education efforts by Solidworks. We were also invited to have a booth during the Solidworks Worlds convention, showcasing our 2018 FRC robot Uppercut! I spent several hours in the booth, talking to professional engineers, design team leaders, and just running our robot through some scoring drills.
